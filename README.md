# GI-Tract-Image-Segmentation


Accurate and automated segmentation of gastroin-testinal (GI) cancer images is crucial during radiation therapy.The goal is to precisely target the tumor with X-ray beams while
sparing healthy regions of the stomach and intestines. Therefore,there is a pressing need for precise GI image segmentation inclinical settings.Unet and Unet++ was proposed in this paper forgastrointestinal image segmentation in CT and MRI. This project combines CNN and transformer models with a weighted module and achieved high Dice score and Jaccard score on segmentation datasets.This method can be extended to medical segmentation in different modalities and can provide decision support for clinical radiotherapy plans.
